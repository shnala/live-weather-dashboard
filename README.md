# live-weather-dashboard

## Description
This weather app allows the user to search for any city in the world and get live weather information for that location, including temperature (farenheit), wind speed, precipitation, and more. It also provides a forecast for the next five days, and saves your search history so that you can make the same query again in the future. This app makes it easy to retrieve weather data without having to navigate through those clunky, slow-to-load and ad-riddled weather sites, and it's taught me how to integrate third-party-API's into my apps so that I can dynamically render elements onto a page based on user input. Sounds pretty critical to any website if you ask me.

## Installation
The app is easy to use and accessible on the web. Just go to this url and enter your query into the search form on the page.
